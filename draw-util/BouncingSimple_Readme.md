# `BouncingSimple` class

This is meant to be a head-first introduction to writing logic in Java
and working with numbers.

The two broken classes, `_TooLow` and `_TooHigh`, demonstrate a bug I
originally had. I think getting newbies to this point will help them
learn certain concepts and flex the logical parts of their minds, and
debugging it at that point, to reach the correct state in
`BouncingSimple` will too.

The progression might go from:

- Draw a circle -- just to show how that works

- Draw a circle moving downward -- introduces a state variable

- Draw a circle accelerating downward -- another state variable, and
makes them think a bit

- Bouncing, and the problems above

- Perhaps including `x` and `vx`, and horizontal bouncing. Or, go
straight to using a `Ball` class, and then perhaps mouse clicks to
create new balls, and then after include horizontal movement.
